I am a research fellow with the Dynamic Legged Systems Group, headed by <a href='https://dls.iit.it/people-details/-/people/claudio-semini'> Claudio Semini </a> at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. Previously, I was a Research Associate at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Science </a>, working on Continual Learning at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) </a> with a Dual Degree, Bachelor's and Master's degree, in Engineering Design. 

In my current research, I focus on inducing biases using model-based priors to learn safe and robust vision-aided locomotion. I am broadly interested in supervised learning, reinforcement learning and control theory to apply them in robotics for control and planning in ardous scenarios.
