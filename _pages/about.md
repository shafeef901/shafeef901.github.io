I am a PhD student with the ATARI Lab at TUM, supervised by <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/khadiv-majid">Majid Khadiv</a>. 

Previously, I was a research fellow with the Dynamic Legged Systems (DLS) Group, headed by <a href='https://dls.iit.it/people-details/-/people/claudio-semini'> Claudio Semini </a> at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. Before that, I was a Research Associate at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Science</a>, working on Continual Learning at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) </a> with a Dual Degree, Bachelor's and Master's degree, in Engineering Design. 

My current research focuses on inducing biases using model-based priors to learn safe and robust vision-aided <b>loco-manipulation</b> policies for <b>legged robots</b>, including long-term <b>task and motion planning</b>.
