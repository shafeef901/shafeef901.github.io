I am a PhD student with ATARI Lab, supervised by <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/khadiv-majid">Prof. Majid Khadiv</a>. 

Previously, I was a research fellow with the <a href="https://dls.iit.it/"> Dynamic Legged Systems (DLS) </a> Group, headed by <a href='https://dls.iit.it/people-details/-/people/claudio-semini'> Claudio Semini </a> at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, where I worked on quadrupeds for safe vision-aided locomotion. Before that, I was a Research Associate at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Science</a>, where I worked on Continual Learning for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in neural networks at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory. I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) </a> with a Dual Degree, Bachelor and Master of Technology. 

My current research focuses on inducing biases using model-based priors to learn safe and robust vision-aided <b>loco-manipulation</b> policies for <b>legged robots</b>, including long-term <b>task and motion planning</b>.
